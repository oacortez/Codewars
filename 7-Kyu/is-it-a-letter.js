- I had to google this solution to find out helper functions because I was not 
able to figure it out
- I solve this solution using for of loop.
- first we create the for of loop
- inside the for loop we create a if statement
- in the if state we check if a character is not more than or equal to lowercase 'a
and character is less than or equal to lowercase 'z'
- and we also check if a character is less or more than or equal to uppercase A and Z 
then return false else return true.
