/* 
Trolls are attacking your comment section! A common way to deal with 
this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, 
neutralizing the threat.Your task is to write a function that takes a 
string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example: 
the string "This website is for losers LOL!" 
would become -> "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

PSUEDOCODE ⬇️

PROBLEM: CREATE A FUNCTION THAT TAKES A PARAMETER - STRING. THIS FUNCTION
NEEDS TO REMOVE ALL VOWELS - A,E,I,O,U BUT NOT Y. RETURN A NEW STRING 
WITH ALL THE VOWELS REMOVED. 

INPUT: STRING
OUTPUT: NEW STRING WITH VOWELS REMOVED

BRAINSTORM: 
- I might need to create a variable and start it off as a empty string
- create an array and assign them to vowels
- I need to iterate every single letter from the parameter 
- check the array of vowels with the parameter
- create a conditional checking if it contains any vowels
- remove every single vowel expect for "y" 
- return a new string 

- edge cases: 
- The parameter has upper and lower case string values
- need to convert all strings to lowercase to have no issues
