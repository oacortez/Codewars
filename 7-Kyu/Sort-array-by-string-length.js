/**
 
PROMPT:

Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.

function sortByLength (array) {
}

/**
 
Input: Array
Output Array

General thought: I am given a list of elements inside an Array. I need to find the lowest to highest 
word count from that list and I need to sort it based on the lowest count word to highest


Thoughts:
- Might need to loop thru each element 
- use .length to see how many characters each string has
