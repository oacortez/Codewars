/** 
PROMPT: Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and 
then sums the results together.

For example: [1, 2, 2] 
it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

/** 
PROBLEM: I am given a array and I need to square root each element inside the array and have 
to add them all up once all elements are square rooted.

Input: Array of negative and positive number values
Output: total num of all elements of the array

Brainstorm:

- have a counter that starts at 0 
- use a array method to iterate through each element 
- use a special math method(pow) to square each element inside the array
- use addition assignment with my counter to get total value of all elements inside the array
