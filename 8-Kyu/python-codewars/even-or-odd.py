def even_or_odd(number):

Input: Number
Output: String of Even or Odd based on return result

General thought: I am given a number type and based off that I need to create math solution to find Even or Odd

Steps:
- Use conditional if statement in other to check if Number is odd or even
- Use module math (%) this checks if number is 0 or 1 based on number 
- return string of even or odd based on return result
- should pass test!
