/**
 
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. 
The numbers can be negative or non-integer. 
If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

Examples:
Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
Output: 9.2

Input: []
Output: 0

Input: [-2.398]
Output: -2.398

Assumptions:
You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.

let result = 0; 

if(numbers.length === 0) {
  return result
} else {
  for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {

Psuedocode: 

General thought:
I am given an array of numbers 
I need to sum all numbers up 
If input(ARRAY) has no value then return 0 

steps:
have a starter value of 0
Check if the array has any value 
If it does loop it if not then return 0 
I need to loop thru each index in the array 
add the started value with current index (+=) -- addition assignment 
return final value
